# Spotipy (a lesson in the importance of prior research...)

Spotipy was supposed to be my own implementation of a Python module designed to interface with Spotify's Web API, and I got a good chunk of the way through starting it. 
I got to practice some object-oriented Python (which I hadn't explored previously) and I got some hands-on experience working with APIs, authentication, and JSON.
Then, halfway through developing the object structure, I did some quick Googling and discovered there's already a fully fleshed-out [Python module](https://spotipy.readthedocs.io/en/pga-v1.1.55/) with the **same name** that does the **same thing.** Oops... <br><br>
So, I ended up just using that in the application I needed Spotify integration for. However, there's still a good 300 lines here of perfectly suitable module foundation, and it was something I really enjoyed getting tangled in the weeds with. Perhaps someday if I find that the *real* Spotipy doesn't suit my needs for a project, I'll come back and finish my own reimplementation.
